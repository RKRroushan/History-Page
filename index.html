<h1>First War</h1>
<p>
The Battle of the Somme, also known as the Somme Offensive, 
was one of the largest battles of the First World War. 
Fought between July 1 and November 1, 1916, near the Somme River in France,
 it was also one of the bloodiest military battles in history. 
 On the first day alone, the British suffered more than 57,000 casualties, 
 and by the end of the campaign the Allies and Central Powers would lose more than 1.5 million men.

	 <h2>Second War</h2>
<p>The Somme campaign in 1916 was the first great offensive of World War I for the British,
 and it produced a more critical British attitude toward the war.
 During and after the Somme, the British army started a real improvement in tactics.
 Also, the French attacked at the Somme and achieved greater advances on July 1 than the British did, with far fewer casualties.
